<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000">    <font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">Symbolism described and popularized in the west by Jung has for a very long time held captive our imaginations concerning the unseen and it's representation in artistic expression--poetry, painting, architecture, etc. As is the case in most sciences and disciplines in the west the art of symbol, whether of the great painters of the 19th century or the poets of the Metaphysical Movement, has it's origin in the east. So it is in the study of Symbol that one encounters the voice of God in the immenant and present experential basis in Sufism. It is interesting that the symbol understood in context in Iran of Sufi origin can be misunderstood in the west thus, it is important to have an idea of what the original context of a Sufi symbol carries in the context of the present page of it's environment or field of relationships. To quote the work of Lewisohn on this subject:</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in;MARGIN-LEFT:0.5in"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">"(the symbolist) Those who approach Sufi poetry as a statement of archetypal logopoeia, that is to say, as a communication derived from the imaginal world ('alam-i mithal) or the realm of archetypal meanings ('alam-i ma'na), understanding it as an expression of precise symbolic meanings working systematically at a supraconscious associative level. Although scholars such as Toshihiko Izutsu, S.H. Nasr, and Henry Corbin have examined Pesian philosophical doctrines from this point of view , no one has examined Persian metaphysical poetry from this standpoint, even though this is the mode of classical lliterary criticism employed by the Sufis themselves. Considering the importance of symbolic structure and meaning as the main criterion of asssessing a poem's ultimate meaning among the Sufis, it seems worthwhile to investigate the underlying philosophical assumptions of this poetic symbolism, the study of which has been neglected by Iranologists East and West alike."[1] </font></font></p>

<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000">    <font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">In Sufism the term used to designate manifestation is mazhar. It is derivative of the Arabic word zuhur, "place of outward appearance". Hence, it is known as manifestation the appearance of an outer expression in form of an internal thought which is unmanifest in the world of appearance. The term in Shi'ite and Sufi circles is strongly associated with the Imam, in the sense of successor to prophet in an interpretive and guiding faculty, not the Prophet nor the wali of God. Waliyat or guardianship is identified by the Kubrawiya Tariqa (sufi order or school) as being intimate with God. Waliyat is "an Arabic verbal noun derived from the root 'wly', it carries the basic meaning of 'friendship', assistance, and 'authority, power'. A fundamental notion of Islamic social and spiritual life, the term is used with a complex variety of meanings related to the function, position, authority of a 'wali'...It appears in Persian as valayat, vilayat and in turkish as vilayet." The Sufi definition of Waliyat is as a charismatic nature associated with miracles (karamat). Al-Jurjani wrote "a wali is in oblivion (fana') of himself but subsisting (baqa') in contemplation." Ala al-Dawlah Simnani wrote of the dual nature of Prophet Muhammad; his prophetic nature and his wilayat or mystical experience. The plural of waliyat is that of the friends of God which is known as the awliya (saints) some hadith, of grade mursal, relating to these awliya are:</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">"...[the awliya are] under God's tents, unknown to anyone but him." </font></font></p>

Hence, the idea of a genral prophethood (nubuwwa 'amma) is invoked in the idea of walayat. Which is non-legislative being spritiual in basis not authoritative.[4]</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000">    <font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">This Walayat or intimacy with God is seen in symbolic representation in Sufism with the teachings of the Arab sufi Sahl at-Tustari who teaches that the Resurrection (qiyama) will allow man to approach the meeting with God (liqa'u'llah), the vision of Truth (an-nazar ila'l-haqq), and thelife in the permanence of Truth (baqa al-haqq). Thus, in at-Tustari's conception the manifestation of God in the sense of the theophany of the Transcendent Reality is consumated in the resurrection not in earthly existence, it is in this future age that God will manifest Himself to His 'awliya.</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000">    <font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">Returning to the concept of manifestation (mazhar) we must draw our attention to the early Sufi understanding of this concept. At-Tustari an early Sunni Sufi of Iraq held that mazhar and the term tajalli (effulgence) held the same meaning Kalabadi on Tustari's beliefs writes: "Sahl, said, there are three modes (ahwal) of theophany (tajalli): theophany of the divine essence (tajalli dhat) which is unveiling (muskhashafah), thoephany of the divine attributes (tajalli sifat al-dhat) which is illumination (mawdi an-nur), and theophany of the divine decree (tajalli hukm al-dhat)."[5]</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000">    <font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">In at-Tustari's definition manifestation is not a single referent for a unique event but is an term with implications in a differential of appearances we can see a similiar concept in many Sufi authors. Also of importance is the work of Simnani on manifestation he holds that "in order to maintain the absolute transcendence and oneness of Divinity, Simnani incoroporates a system of mirror imagery within his scheme of emenation. According to this scheme, a subsequent emanation is the locus of manifestation (mazhar) of the object from which it emanates, the word mazhar implying a place of appearance or manifestation in which there is an immediate correspondence between the mirror image (or outward manifestation) and the object reflected or manifested therein. This concept endeavors to remove any possibility of divine indwelling (hulul) in a created entity."[6]</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in">    <font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">Important for the study of manifestation in Sufism is the work of Ibn 'Arabi who held that tajalli (manifestation) is the process of God's Self-Manifestaition delimiting Itself or determining Itself for Itself by Itself. (Ta'ayyun, making oneself a particular, individual entity). It is the basis of this self-determination that Ibn 'Arabi holds the universe is a manifestation of. Qashani, Ibn 'Arabi's pupil, relates that according to Ibn 'Arabi there are six levels of manifestation: </font></font></p>

<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">Interestingly for Ibn 'Arabi Tajalli is equal to Emenation (fayd). It is written that there are two types of emenations in Ibn Arabi's thought-- Fayd al-aqdas (Most Holy Emenation) and fayd al-muqaddas (Holy Emenation). Qashani writes regarding this emenation:</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in;MARGIN-LEFT:0.5in"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">"The essential self-manifestation is the appearance of the absolute under the form of the permanent archetypes which are ready to receive existence and whose domain is the Presence of Knowledge and Names, i.e. the Presence of Oneness (wahadit). By this appearance the Absolute descends from the presence of Unity (ahadit) to the Presence of Oneness. And this is the 'most holy emenation' of the Absolute, which consists in that the pure Essence not yet accompanied by any Names manifests itself (in the Plane of the Names). So there can be no plurality at all (in actuality) in this self-manifestation which occurs in the visible world as actualization of the Names, which therfore occurs in accordance with the 'preparedeness' of each locus." </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">Thus we can see that there are number of different ways that Sufi authorities discuss the terms of Manifestation and Intimacy. Where manifestation is the substance and intimacy the individuation of that substance in experential terms in spiritual discourse.[7]</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000">    <font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">The Development of Iranian Sufism, in comparison to other Sufi developments in other nations, has been largely influenced by the poetic imagery of the Sufis. The philosophical description of the world is alluded to through the rhythmic verse of poetry. This development has it's source in the Arabic poetry before the rise of Iranian sufism. These Arab poets such as Qays whose initial depiction of the story of Majnun &amp; Layli is later taken to Persia and popularized. The initial allusion to the usurpation of the Rightly Guided Caliphate by the Umayyad heresy is taken to a mystical level in the writings of the Persians. These writings of Sufi authors in Iran has three categories: adab-- ethical discourses, religious inspiration-- the esoteric tafsir, and Sufi literature proper-- the discourse regarding the steps on the path and the elements of the steps. This Sufi literature is written in a style of quatraints (ruba'i), rhyming couplets (mathnawi) or sonnetic (ghazal).</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">There are several literary devices used in Sufism the important element in literary works of Sufism is the concept of allegorical similitude (mathal). This is initially derived from the writings within the </font></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"><span lang="en-US">Qur'an</span></font></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> where it is recorded that God disdains not to speak in allegories (Surah al-Baqara). In Sufism, the literary devices are </font></font></font><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"><span lang="en-US">symbol (ramz), gesturing (ima), metaphor (kenaya) and allusion (ishara) [see Chapter 1].</span></font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000">    <font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">Allegory has been a large stumbling block to others outside the Sufi tradition in understanding the symbolic utterance of the Sufis. Perhaps the most important element of Sufi utterance is that of Shathiyyat, the ecstatic utterance relating the sufis perception of reality and identification within the sufi as being a part of the object of his direct contemplation thus unifying object with subject in an ecstatic moment. This is the basis of the famous utterance by the al-Hallaj: "I am the Truth (Haqq)". It has been arguably related that this is not an utterance with a literal truth but is an utterance full of symbolic meaning relating the Sufis love and intimacy with the object of his contemplation. It is also seen in Mirza Husayn-'Ali Baha' Allah's writing that "I am He and He is I" (Anna Huwa wa Huwa anna).</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000">    <font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">One of the greatest Sufi and scholars of Islam al-Ghazzali writes of the use of symbolic metaphor in Sufism as:</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in;MARGIN-LEFT:0.5in"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">"We mean by metaphor or analogue (mathal) to render meaning (ma'na) into the external form (surah). So if one sees its inner meaning, he finds it true. But if he sees only its external form, he finds it deceiving...The prophets can talk to the people only by means of the metaphors (amthal), since it is necessary to talk to the people in accordance with their intellect. Their intellect is on the sleeper's level. So it is necessary to make use of metaphors to explain to the sleeper...their understanding does not go beyond the apparent meaning, because of their ignorance of the interpretation, called 'metaphorical interpretation' (ta'wil), as the decipherment symbolls in dream is called 'the interpretation of dream' (ta'bir)" [Ihya, IV, 23-24] [9] </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000">    <font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">The Evolution of Sufism in Iran is intimately tied to the literary sources of Iranian Sufism. This literary sources can be divided into critical periods of development the first of which is the early period. The Early period authors of Iranian sufism is founded by Abu'l-Hasan ibn 'Uthman Hujwiri (d. 465/1071) with his Kashf al-Mahjub (the Unveiling of the Veiled). Active also during this period is the first poet of Iranian Sufism Abu Sa'id Abi'l-Khayr (d. 440/1089), a contemporary of Baba Tahir. Also, is the early sufi works of 'Abd God 'Ansari (d. 1089), whose Manazallut (the Sent Down) is quoted by Baha' Allah in the Haft Vadi, his famous work the 100 Fields and the Manazil as-Sairin became fundamental works for later Sufi thought. The development of Sufism after this early period is a development toward the concept of Mahhabat.</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

Following his work is that of Farid al-Din 'Attar, who we shall see more later, and of course the master of the mathnawi Jalal al-Din "Rumi", the founder of the Mevlevi Sufi Order in Konya and the author of the famous Mathnawi, an esoteric commentary on the Quran. Other authors of interest are thse of Awhad al-Din Kirmanif (d. 1238) a shaykh of the Suhrawardiyah order. He expounded a doctrine of beauty and was a supporter of Ibn 'Arabi. Later, was the work of Shaykh Mahmud Shabistari (d. 1320) author of the Gulshan-i Raz (the Garden of Divine Mysteries).</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

The poets of Shiraz where known as the exppounders of strong jurisprudential and mystical tendencies. Sa'di (d. 1296) the author of the Gulistan was a member of the Suhrawardiya order.

He had an extra-ordinary talent to combine the profoundest thought with the most delicate poetic images. In his poetry one observes the final and most perfect wedding between exalted spirituality and vivid sensuality. He speaks of the Divine Names and Qualities while describing the hair of the beloved moving gently in the morning breeze. He aludes to the more esoteric of Sufi doctrines while emphasizing the importance of the Shari'ah...the spiritual and the the sensual are woven together in a poetry which is itself a vehicle that carries man to the exalted proximity of the Divine Empyrean". </font></font></p>

After Sadi the high point of Persian Sufi poetry declines with a few brilliant stars appearing in remote instances. It is interesting to note the resurgence of Sufism in general during the 19th century and hence, the development of strong sufi poetic tendencies in the mystic Mirza Husayn-'Ali Baha' Allah, Baha’u’llah.</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000">    <font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">It is important to trace out the development of the Kubrawi order in Iran as it shall be seen that this is a major source of influence upon all Sufis in Iran and specifically, the majority of Sufi authors quoted by Mirza Husayn-'Ali Baha' Allah are members of the Kubrawi order. The Kubrawi order developed out of the Sunni tradition of Iran before the conversion by royal decree of the populace to Ithna Asharism. The Kubrawi was founded by Najm al-Din Kubra (d. 1221) he was an expounder of a unique visionary experience based on Divine Lights. This doctrine was followed by all the major Kubrawi Shaykhs. Following the Silsalah of the Kubrawi we see the major Shaykhs of this order such as Majd al-Din Baghdadi the teacher of Farrid-Din Attar. After Majd we see Baha al-Din Walad (d. 1231) who was the father and teacher of Jalal al-Din Rumi. Following Baha we see Najm al-Din Dayah ar-Razi (d. 1256) and later we have the important sufi doctrinal expounder 'Ala al-Dawlah Simnani (d. 1336). Simnani's legacy can be seen not only in the Kubrawi but also in the Naqshbandi order and writings of Shah Wali'llah, especially the doctrine of Wahdat al-Shuhud.</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">The influences on Mirza Husayn-'Ali Baha' Allah can be seen through Rumi and 'Attar in poetic terms. In doctrinal terms there is a great similarity between Simnani and Baha' Allah and Baha' Allah's son, Abbas Effendi Abdu'l-Baha. Other influences or similarities on Mirza Husayn-'Ali can be seen from Shah Wali'llah and Ansari.</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000">    <font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">It is important to point out the development of the Kubrawi order after the 15th Century. The Kubrawiya order branched into two different orders after the 15th century. The two branches where both Shi'a orders, it was not until after the branching and the rise of the Shi'ite monarchy that the Kubrawi left it's Sunni heritage. The two branches where the Dhahabi Order centered in Shiraz. And the Nurbakhshi order which became allied with the Shah and had several murids of the order appointed as ministers in the Shah's administration. It is important to note regarding the Dhahabi order that the order had some interesting parallels to later Bahai teachings and influences. These include hermetic influences, the use of gold in symbolism, the use of talismans and the emphasis on visions relating to the hidden Imam.[11]</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

In Sufism the symbolic is expressed through a varied ways of expression. No longer do we have the common literal meaning attached to things. No longer is a light merely a collection of photonic discharges, but is an expression of divine source or enlightenment, a non-physical non-literal expression attached to a common literal object but having an internal vocabulary known to the adept which reveals itself in a code which can exalt the adept to a higher plane understanding the code attached to the literal object which is a symbol of the esoteric. Nicholson writes of the Sufi symbolic style:</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in;MARGIN-LEFT:0.5in"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">"...the Sufis adopt the symbolic style because there is no other way of interpreting mystical experience. So little does knowledge of the infinite revealed in ecstatic vision need an artificial disguise that it cannot be communicated at all except through types and emblems drawn from the sensible world, which, imperfect as they are, may suggest and shadow forth a deeper meaning than appears on the surface."[12] </font></font></p>

The most famous of the Seven Stations are those of Farrid-din 'Attar who wrote of seven valleys. It was his ‘Mantaq-i Tur’ (Conference of the Birds) which became the same archetypical format that Mirza Husayn-'Ali Baha' Allah used to write of the spiritual stations using the same names of stations as Farrid-Din Attar: Vadi-ye Talab, Vadi-ye 'Ishq, Vadi-ye Marifat, Vadi-ye Istighna', Vadi-ye Tawhid, Vadi-ye Hairat, Vadi-ye Faqr wa Fana.</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

We see that for Sarraj we will see the development of the stations along an less poetic form, as is the case with Farrid al-Din 'Attar and as we progress through time the luxariant symbols of Mirza Husayn-'Ali take on an atmosphere which is clearly removed, intellectualy, from the world of phenomenon.</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

In this instance we speak of seeking God's inner reality. However, our own inner reality must by transformed for us to seek the inner reality of God, eventhough we realize it is an impossible task in material and metaphysical terms. To be an enlightened being according to the Qur'an is to be a Muhsin (a doer of good). It is recorded in the verse: "And who can be better in religion than one who submits his essential being to God; and he is a Muhsin. And follows the religion of Abraham-- Hanifa. And God did take Abraham as an intimate friend." (4:125) [wa min ahusan diynaa mim man islam wajhah God wa huwa muhsin wa atba'a millat Ibrahim haniyfaa wa atakhdha God inrahyma khalyla] Muhsin is the turning of ones inner life to the reality of God. So in this sense it is Sufistic, the turning away from outer distraction to inner tranquility. Abdullah 'Ansari writes of Patience:</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

The patence over (or indulgence in complete) obedience is due to hopefulness.

It is important to realize the designation in Arabic between 'ilm and marifat, 'ilm designates the knowledge of the science of something and is similiar to french savoir, whereas marifat is to know something in an interior and close sense not so much a science but an experience and it is similiar to french 'faire'. So we see that the valley of knowledge (marifat) is not a scientific knowing but is more emotional and direct. The great sufi doctrinarian Hujwiri, writes about marifat as:</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in;MARGIN-LEFT:0.5in"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">"The Apostle said: 'If ye knew Divinity as It ought to be known, ye would walk on the seas, and the mountains would move at your call'. Gnosis of Divinity is of two kinds: conditional ('ilmi) and emotional (hali)....Theologians, lawyers, and other classes of men give the name of gnosis (marifat) to right cognition ('ilm) of Divinity, but the Sufi Shaykhs call right feeling (hal) towards Divinity by that name. Hence they have said that gnosis (marifat) is more excellent than cognition ('ilm), for right feeling (hal) is the result of right cognition, but right cognition is not the same thing as right feeling, i.e. one who has not cognition of Divinity is not a gnostic ('arif), but one may have cognition of Divinity without being a gnostic."[19] </font></font></p>

In these works we see the ideal of abondonment of the illusory for the appreciation of the Real (al-Haqq). In Islamic philosophy the understanding of the relationship between unicity and duality is similiar to that of numerological developments. Out of the one we get two. Hence, the further one is from the primary root of one the more numerous the divisions and multiplicity. So to suggest seeing the unicity in the duality is not only the recognition of the manifest oneness in all things but also to grow nearer in conscious awareness toward the unicity of origin. In the case of the Sufi this origin is God. </font></font></p>

Fractals existing in multiples still maintain their original shape and form of thier mother. A fractal, in fact, is a configuration composed of each element being the same as the other elements that in their totality maintain the structure and shape of each element. As paradoxical this may seem the theory of manifestation is one which supposses the similiar idea. Counter this with the Qur`anic denial of giving God any natural or anthropomorphical analogs we realize that what we see in creation of the Creator may very well indeed be the plan of the Creator not the creator itself. Thus, we realize that the manifest oneness is the one word of the Command to create, namely, "Be" and it is. (Kun yafakun). Later we shall see how this promotes the idea of annihilation into God's Will.</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

Avicenan and Ghazzalan Recital: "If thou be a man of communion and prayer, soar up on the wings of assistance from Holy Souls, that thou mayest behold the mysteries of the Friend and Attain to the lights of fthe Beloved. 'Verily, we are from Divinity and to Him shall we return.'"(pg. 17, Haft Vadi) This passage from Baha' Allah's treatise indicates a common sufi stream of thought: the idea of soaring heavenward toward contact with the Luminous. This soaring is not so much a heavenly journey through time and spatial awareness but rather through a metaphysical virtual reality-- the journey of vision. The earliest visounary recital as it is known in the Sufi world is attributed to Ibn Sina whose father and Grandfather where members of the Ismaili Shi'a community. His early recital was later taken up by Ghazzali the once critic of Sufism and Ismailism and later an avid Sufi himself. The Visionary recital is composed of a mystic voyage toward the Heavenly Mountains (Ar. tur as-samawati) as has been seen in Haft Vadi and the writings of 'Attar. Both the Avicennan and Ghazzalan recital use the bird image as symbol for the soul as it ascends to the King. Of course we see this symbol used by 'Attar and in shorter episodes by Baha' Allah.</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

The birds thought that they should have a king, and thatn none was worthier to rule over them than the bird 'Anqa. Whereupon they learn that she has gone to dwell in a distant and utterly inaccessible island. Such is their ardent desire, and such the firmness of their resolution, that they nevertheless decide to set out to find her, to put themselves under her protection and be admitted to her court. To be sure, they are warned: before you are endless deserts, vetigionous summits, suffocating vapors, regions of heat asnd regions of cold. You will faint before you have reached the goal of your desire! But the warning was given in vain. Tey set out. Each mounted the steed of firm resolution, putting on it the the bridle of ardent desire. And what was bound to happen came to pass: those who were from warm countries died in the cold regions, those who were from cold countries perished in the regions of heat; others fell, pitiful victims of the storms and accidents they encountered. Finally, only a small band reached the distant island of the bird 'Anqa.</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

They asked that she would at least deign to appear, in order to become thier king. But the stupefying answer came: 'You have wearied yourseleves in vain. We are King, whether you consent or refuse, whether you come or depart. We have noneed of you.' When they understood that they were regarded as of no account and that their desire was treated with the most contemptuous indifference, they succumbed to despair and shame, they felt disillusioned, helpless. They told one another thtat the road of return was closed to them: their strength did not suffice to attempt it, their passion had exhausted them. Better to die where they were, even to the last of them.</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

Another message was brought them: 'Away, away with despair of Divinity's mercy (Qur'aan 12:87)'. If our perfect independence of all things demanded that you be treated with scorn and and rebuffed, the beauty of munifecence demands that you be received and treated with unstinted gentleness. Now that you have experienced the measure of your impotence to know our measure, it befits us that you have here your dwelling ...It befits the King 'Anqa that she choose freely him who has become really concious of his own unworthiness.' Savoring the joys of familiarity after having known despair, the birds inquired concerning the fate of their companions who had fallen on the road and would never arrive....They were ansewered: 'Beware, beware! If any goes forth from his house to flee to Divinity and His Prophet, and death overtakes him, his reward is in the Hand of Divinity (Qur'aan 4:149)'. 'Say, not of them who have been killed on the way of Divinity that they are dead. Nay, they are alive (11:149).'"[22]</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

God does not move toward us but we must move toward God. In this moving is great sacrifice and a transformation of the inner reality of one's soul.</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

(Pg.20, Haft Vadi) As mentioned in the previous example the Nightengale or Bird (tayr) is the vehicle of the soul in sufi symbolism. The bird is written of in the following examples:</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

Indeed, the wayfarer findeth a secret in every name, a mystery in every letter. In one sense, these letters refer to holiness." (Haft Vadi) </font></font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">In the description of the contents of the letters of the Persian Bird "Gunjishk" Baha' Allah defines each consonant as a step in the purification process he identifies "G" with freeing thyself from earthly attachments; "N" with purifying oneself; "J" with purifying one's intentions toward God; "Sh" with thanking (shukara) God for His Grace; and "K" for the unwrapping of limitations of the soul. This can be counterpoised to the similair five steps written of by Jami:</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

When the Illumination of the Divine Essence is revealed like a moth the spirit flings itself onto it and vanishes in it's radiance it loses the consiousness of it's individuality and a Divine Substance with Divine Attributes is substituted.</font></font></font></p>

It is mentioned of vision that one must open the inward seeing to approach love or see the beauty of the wilderness. Vision in Sufism is accorded as:</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

God Almighty says: '...they call to mind (Divinity and His commandments) and Lo; they are enlightened (7:201).' The term Basirat means 'clear vision' it is of three kinds: Insight of Acceptance (rida), Insight of Following (Khalifat); and Insight of Reality (Haqq). The insight of Acceptance is the name of access to the place where love is attained... The insight of Following is to strictly follow the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him)....The Insight of Reality is the sight of the Real Master (Divinity Almighty) with the eyes of heart.....the Insight of acceptance lies in the observation of experiences, signs and proofs; the insight of following lies in the Holy Book, the Sunnah and the tradition of our righteous past Muslims. The insight of reality is a lamp in the heart proclaiming that 'it is Me'; it is a voice in the ear that says: 'I am here'. And an illuminous sight telling that 'I am with you.'"

He saith: 'And there shall appear upon the tablet of thine heart a writing of the subtle mysteries of 'Fear Divinity and Divinity will give you knowledge'[cf. Quran 16:128,23:57]; and the bird of thy soul shall recall the holy sanctuarites of preexistence and soar on the wings of longing in the heaven of 'walk the beaten paths of thy Lord,'(zahir) and gather the fruits of communion in the gardens of 'Then feed on every kind of fruit.'" (batin) (Pg. 4, Haft Vadi) Describing the Haqa'iq: "...besides the orient light of the Essence [see Kubrawiya &amp; Baha' Allah Lights below] in the mirrors of names and attributes--yearning would seize the reins of patience and reserve from out thy hand, and make thy soul to shake with the flashing light, and draw thee from the earthly homeland to the first, heavenly abode in the Center of Realities, and lift thee to a plane wherein thou wouldst soar in the air even as thou walkest upon the earth..." (Pg. 4, Haft Vadi) "...stray not a breadth of a hair from the Law (shariah, the Islamic Law) , for it is indeed the secret of the Path and the fruit of the Tree of 'Truth'; and in all these stages he must cling to the rope of obedience to the commandments, and hold fast to the cord of shunning all forbidden things, that he may be nourished from the cup of the Law and informed of the mysteries of Truth." (Pg. 40, Haft Vadi) In the classical Sufi teachings the distinction between Batin and Zahir is one that is defined as the relationship to the Inner to the Outer. It can have the similitude of the heart, one where the life blood is contained within the vessel of natural tissue of the outer chamber. The Haqa'iq is likened unto the life that is developed out of the relationship of the inner and outer heart working together to nourish the human vessel in it's quest for attaining the nirvana of submission (muslim) to the Will which wills all wills.</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>

<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000">    <font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">In Sufi symbolism the heart is the locus of divine attraction and the seat of righteousness. The early Wahhabi teacher Shaykh Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab reminds us "There is an emphasis on sincerity (ikhlas); for many pretend to call to God when they, in fact, call to themselves.' And the progress of such an understanding develops in stages. First, we must consider the elements of the heart and rememberance. The heart (Ar. Qalb, Per. Dil) in the Qur`an is described as that which allows us the approach with the Lord: 'Behold he approached his Lord with a sound heart.' (37:84) The commentators describe this 'qalb salimi' as a 'heart that is pure, and unaffected by the diseases that afflict others'. As the heart in Arabic is taken to be not only the seat of feelings and affections, but also of intelligence and resulting action, it implies the whole character.' It is the purification of the heart, as mentioned by Baha' Allah in the Haft Vadi, which leads to the purification of our observance of duties of religion and to the obedience of the Will which wills all wills. The heart is also the center of the seating of Faith (iman). The vehicle for such a purification and setting of faith in the heart is that of the rememberance of Alllah, It is the prayer and the dhikr (remembrance ) which generates a force within the wall of our chest which can withstand the viscisitudes of the trangressors of the Way. In a Sahih hadith catalogued by Muslim it is recorded that:</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in;MARGIN-LEFT:0.5in"> <font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">"I am near to the thought of My servant as he thinks about me, and I am with him in My heart, and if he remembers Me in assembly I remember him in assembly, better than his, and if he draws near Me by the span of a palm I draw near him by the cubit, and if he draws near Me by the cubit I draw near him by the space of two hands. And if he walks towards me, I rush towards him". </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">And it is this asscension of the mind with the rememberance of God in the mirroring of the Divine Decree in the heart which engulfs the lover of the Shrouded Supremacy, like Majnun, the lover to his Layli which enthralls the seeker of the spiritual rapture to the reunion of Certainty. Progress of the lovers soul to al-Haqq is that of travelling through states like a ladder. There are three states (Ar. Hal) of the development of the human soul, coincidentally like that of a child in it's mothers feotus: Fist is that as described as 'Ammara': "Yet I do not absolve myself: the soul certainly incites('ammara') to do evil. Unless my Lord do bestow His Mercy: but surely My Lord is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful''. (Qur'an 12:53) This is the stage of the soul commanding to evil. The Second is that of "Lawwama": "And I do swear by the self-reproaching (lawwama) soul." (Qur'an 75:2) This is the soul which commands resistance or is still prone to evil but resists evil. The Third sou is the soul which is called the "Mutamainna" "(to the righteous soul will be said:) 'O soul, in rest and satisfaction ('mutmainna')! Come back thou to thy Lord, well pleased and well-pleasing unto Him! Enter thou, then, among my devotees! Yae, enter thou My Heaven!" (Qur'an 89:27-30) This faithfull soul is that of the highest state of all states and is accomplished through the purification of the heart by way to the observance of perfect righteousness (Ar. Taqwa).</font></font></font><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3"> </font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="MARGIN-BOTTOM:0.19in"><font color="#000000"><font face="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><font size="3">The classical Sufi explanation of the four paths of the heart is attributed to Hakim Tirmidhi, also a sahih hadith scholar, who draws on the relationship of the soul to the heart.

'In the ocean he findeth a drop, in a drop he beholdeth the secrets of the sea.'"(pg. 12, Haft Vadi) "Thus, too, Luqman, who had drunk from the wellspring of wisdom and tasted of the waters of mercy, in proving to his son Nathan the planes of resurrection and death, advanced the dream as an evidence and an example. We relate it here, that through this evanescent Servant a memory may endure of that youth of the school of the Divine Unity..." (Pg. 34, Haft Vadi) In Sufism it is extremely important, especially from the point of view of jurisprudential knowledge, to remember that the term resurrection (qiyamat) is not the Judgement or return of 'Isa that the Quran holds to be the Qiyamat. In Sufism the term qiyamat has another connotation.

Then he ascends and is characterized (yattasifu) by Divine Will, this being more sublime (ajalla) than passing away (al-fana) into Divine Will. This characterization by Divine Will come to an end 3.

This doctrine was first expounded upon by Shah Wali'llah (Sirhindi) the Naqshbandi Sufi of al-Hind. Some scholars give initial claim to this to Simnani.

No man hath ever known Him; no soul hath ever found the pathway to His Being.

Ali al-Qari says: "It has also been said that both the Light and the Book refer to Muhammad (s), because just as he is a tremendous light and the source of all lights, he is also a book that gathers up and makes clear all the secrets" ( Sharh al-Shifa, 1:505).

Ali al-Qari said: "To illumine the hearts of the believers in general and the gnostics in particular," and "Sirajan muniran means a luminous sun, because of His saying: "He hath placed therein a great lamp and a moon giving light" (25:61). Therefore there is in this verse a warning that the sun is the highest of the material lights (al-anwaar al-hissi) and that other lights are outpourings from it: similarly the Prophet (s) is the highest of the spiritual lights and other lights are derived from him by virtue of his mediating connection and pivotal rank in the overall sphere of creation.

Beings, however, are innumerable in their differentiated manifestation.
